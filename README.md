####- [Analyzing Historical Stock and Revenue and Building a Dashboad](https://github.com/vndayambaje/Analyzing-Historical-Stock-Revenue-Data-and-Building-a-Dashboard.git)

  For this project, I assumed the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. My job was to extract financial data like 
  historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data I visualized it in a dashboard to identify 
  patterns or trends. The stocks I worked with were Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.
