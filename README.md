## [Airbnb Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Factors Influencing Customer Ratings and Demand ](https://github.com/vndayambaje/Airbnb_EDA_Project)

  **Objective**: This project aims to explore and analyze the characteristics and features of Airbnb listings to understand their influence on customer ratings and demand. The goal is to provide actionable 
  insights for better decision-making regarding resource allocation.

  **Key Questions**:

  - Which countries have the highest number of Airbnb listings? I identified the top 10 countries based on listing volume.
  - What is the relationship between listing features and ratings? I examined correlations between various listing attributes and customer ratings.
  - How do highly rated and popular listings differ from less popular and lower-rated ones? I compared the features of top-performing listings with those of less successful ones.
  - Which countries exhibit a high number of popular and highly rated listings? I determined countries with both a high volume of top listings and a high percentage of such listings.
  - What are the key locations within these countries that should be prioritized for resource allocation? I identified specific locations where increased investment could yield significant returns.

  **Outcome**: By addressing these questions, we aim to provide leadership with a comprehensive understanding of Airbnb listing dynamics, enabling informed decisions on resource distribution and strategic 
  focus.

## [Analyzing Historical Stock and Revenue and Building a Dashboad](https://github.com/vndayambaje/Analyzing-Historical-Stock-Revenue-Data-and-Building-a-Dashboard.git)

  **Objective**: This project aims to assume the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. My job was to extract 
  financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. 
  
  **Outcome**:After collecting this data I visualized it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks I worked with were Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.
## [AGM Startup Restaurant: Sales Data and Customer Behavior Analysis with Visualization](https://github.com/vndayambaje/ACM-Startup-Restaurant-Sales-Data-and-Customer-Behavior-Analysis-with-Visualization.git)
  **Objective**: This project focused on analyzing sales data for AGM Startup Restaurant using SQL and Python within a Docker cluster, with the goal of extracting actionable insights and creating impactful 
  data visualizations to support the Data Science team in developing the RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) model, ultimately aiming to identify and target the company's most valuable customers.
  
  **outcomes**: By developing and executing SQL queries, I provided deep insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and meal preferences, while creating detailed visualizations with Pandas and Python 
  that enhanced decision-making processes and clearly illustrated key sales metrics; additionally, I proposed and implemented improvements to ETL frameworks, which simplified data transformations and ensured 
  higher accuracy, leading to more reliable analyses.

### Cloud Migration Strategy and Optimization
  
  **Project Description**:
  In this cloud migration project, I played a key role in analyzing and optimizing infrastructure and application performance data post-migration. By leveraging SQL, Python, and predictive analytics, I 
  provided insights to drive decision-making, ensuring operational efficiency and compliance with legal data privacy regulations. I developed a migration strategy that reduced completion time and costs 
  compared to similar projects.
  
  **Responsibilities**:
  - Utilized SQL and Python to create ETL pipelines, extracting and analyzing data from previous projects on team composition, timelines, costs, regulatory requirements, infrastructure capacity, application 
    dependencies, data privacy, security protocols, and both pre- and post-migration performance to develop a comprehensive cloud migration strategy.
  - Translated business objectives into actionable analysis, providing recommendations to client management on decision-making, regulatory compliance, and operational improvements during and after migration.
  - Collaborated with Operations, Data Science, Engineering, and management teams to analyze infrastructure performance, monitor post-migration operational health, and identify opportunities to improve 
    efficiency.
    
  **Results**:
  - Developed a migration strategy that reduced project completion time by 15% and cut project expenditures by 10%.
  - Provided clear insights into infrastructure performance, enabling senior management to optimize resource allocation and address operational challenges post-migration.
  - Strengthened competitive positioning by applying predictive analytics to cloud migration forecasts and operational expenditures, enhancing customer acquisition strategies and ensuring successful project 
    wins.

 ### Infrastructure Performance Optimization and Predictive Maintenance Analytics

   **Project Description**:
   In this project, I focused on analyzing system performance metrics to enhance infrastructure health and efficiency. By leveraging SQL and Python, I provided comprehensive insights into error rates, 
   latency, and resource utilization, leading to improved operational strategies and incident management.
   
   **Responsibilities**:
   - Utilized SQL to collect and query data on system performance, error rates, and resource utilization, enabling thorough analysis of critical infrastructure metrics and identification of performance 
     trends.
   - Employed Python for advanced data analysis and visualization, processing large datasets to uncover latency patterns and error rate correlations, which informed the development of proactive maintenance 
     strategies.
   - Developed and automated reporting tools and dashboards, consolidating metrics from various infrastructures to support SREs in predicting potential failures and optimizing resource allocation.
     
   **Results**:
   - Achieved a 10% reduction in error rates and improved overall system health through detailed analysis and targeted performance improvements.
   - Realized a 20% improvement in incident response times and more effective resource allocation by implementing data-driven maintenance strategies.
   - Enhanced incident management capabilities and streamlined response efforts by consolidating metrics and providing actionable insights through automated reporting tools.
