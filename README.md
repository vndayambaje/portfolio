## Projects
- [Airbnb Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Factors Influencing Customer Ratings and Demand ](https://github.com/vndayambaje/Airbnb_EDA_Project)

**Objective**: This project aims to explore and analyze the characteristics and features of Airbnb listings to understand their influence on customer ratings and demand. The goal is to provide actionable 
  insights for better decision-making regarding resource allocation.

**Key Questions**:

  1. Which countries have the highest number of Airbnb listings? I identified the top 10 countries based on listing volume.
  2. What is the relationship between listing features and ratings? I examined correlations between various listing attributes and customer ratings.
  3. How do highly rated and popular listings differ from less popular and lower-rated ones? I compared the features of top-performing listings with those of less successful ones.
  4. Which countries exhibit a high number of popular and highly rated listings? I determined countries with both a high volume of top listings and a high percentage of such listings.
  5. What are the key locations within these countries that should be prioritized for resource allocation? I identified specific locations where increased investment could yield significant returns.

**Outcome**: By addressing these questions, we aim to provide leadership with a comprehensive understanding of Airbnb listing dynamics, enabling informed decisions on resource distribution and strategic focus.

**Objective**: This project aims to assume the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. My job was to extract 
  financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. 
**Outcome**:After collecting this data I visualized it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks I worked with were Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.
